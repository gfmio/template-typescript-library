# Repository Rulesets
#
# > Warning
# >
# > Support for Repository Rulesets is still under development. Details may still change, like how the configuration is defined in the settings.yml. Please follow #732 for progress updates. Feedback is appreciated, but adopt cautiously, with the expectation of breaking changes until support is fully released.

# > Important

# > deployment_branch_policy differs from the API for ease of use. Either protected_branches (boolean) OR custom_branches (array of strings) can be provided; this will manage the API requirements under the hood.
# >
# > See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/branch-policies for documentation of custom_branches. If both are provided in an unexpected manner, protected_branches will be used.
# >
# > Either removing or simply not setting deployment_branch_policy will restore the default 'All branches' setting.
